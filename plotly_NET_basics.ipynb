    "\n",
    "Plotly.NET is a .NET wrapper for creation of [plotly charts](plot.ly). This means that, under the hood, all functionality creates JSON objects that can be rendered by plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plotly.js chart consists of 3 objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data`, which is a collection of `traces` which represent the data and chart type used to visualize the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* `layout`, which controls the general chart layout such as axis positions and styles\n",
    "\n",
    "* `config` high level properties of the chart like making all chart elements editable or the tool bar on top\n",
    "\n",
    "These are mirrored in Plotly.NET's central type, `GenericChart`:\n",
    "\n",
    "## GenericChart\n",
    "\n",
    "The central type that gets created by all Chart constructors is `GenericChart`, which itself represents either a single chart or a multi chart (as a Discriminate Union type). It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "type GenericChart =\n",
    "    | Chart of Trace * Layout * Config * DisplayOptions\n",
    "    | MultiChart of Trace list * Layout * Config * DisplayOptions\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a `GenericChart` consists of four top level objects - `Trace` (multiple of those in the case of a MultiChart) , `Layout`, `Config`, and `DisplayOptions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Trace` is in principle the representation of a dataset on a chart, including for example the data itself, color and shape of the visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Layout` is everything of the chart that is not dataset specifivc - e.g. the shape and style of axes, the chart title, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Config` is an object that configures high level properties of the chart like making all chart elements editable or the tool bar on top\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DisplayOptions` is an object that contains meta information about how the html document that contains the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers of abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly.NET uses multiple layers of abstractions to generate valid plotly.js JSON objects with different levels of control and complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Chart module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Chart` module provides the highest layer of abstraction. Here, plotly.js trace types are broken down to the most common and useful styling options, and combined with common layout settings.\n",
    "It also provides composite charts which consist of multiple traces such as `Chart.Range`, which really is a combination of 3 scatter traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we recommend always using named arguments - even for mandatory arguments - as future changes/addition to the API might change the argument order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example on how to create a simple 2D point chart:\n",
